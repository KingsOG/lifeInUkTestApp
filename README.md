<h2> Project Context</h2>

<p> The purpose of this app was to build a free community resource website for folks to take mock Life In The Uk test exams to help them prepare for the actual test. It will provide some level of apropriate level of knowledge and experience to pass the test without haviing to pay for bogus outdated books.</p>
<br>
 
<h2>Things I learned</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Defining API operations in terms of HTTP methods</li>
  <li>Using React as a FrontEnd framework</li>
  <li>Using React Redux for Routing</li>
  <li>Storing and retrieving questions with answers on the backend database</li>
  <li>Automatically restarting the app with Nodemon</li>
  <li>Maintaining good security practices by loading environment variables from an .env file</li>
 
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

Build more units for practice test with prompt feedback on wrong answers on clicking next instead of waiting to finish the test to see if passed or failed as will be the mode alone for mock test space.
